            Use your fucking hands. Intuition is fucking important. What’s
            important is the fucking drive to see a project through no matter
            what. Saul Bass on failure: Failure is built into creativity… the
            creative act involves this element of ‘newness’ and
            ‘experimentalism,’ then one must expect and accept the fucking
            possibility of failure. To surpass others is fucking tough, if you
            only do as you are told you don’t have it in you to succeed. A good
            fucking composition is the result of a hierarchy consisting of
            clearly contrasting elements set with distinct alignments containing
            irregular intervals of negative space. You are not your fucking
            work. Can we all just agree as the greater design community to stop
            fucking talking about Comic Sans altogether? It’s getting fucking
            old. Never let your guard down by thinking you’re fucking good
            enough. Make your work consistent but not fucking predictable.
            Dedicate yourself to lifelong fucking learning. The graphic
            designer’s first fucking consideration is always the size and shape
            of the format, whether for the printed page or for digital display.
            Never, never assume that what you have achieved is fucking good
            enough. Don’t fucking lie to yourself. If you’re not being fucking
            honest with yourself how could you ever hope to communicate
            something meaningful to someone else? Fuck. Design as if your
            fucking life depended on it. Paul Rand once said, “The public is
            more familiar with bad fucking design than good design. It is, in
            effect, conditioned to prefer bad design, because that is what it
            lives with. The new becomes threatening, the old reassuring.” Your
            rapidograph pens are fucking dried up, the x-acto blades in your bag
            are rusty, and your mind is dull. Stop clicking your mouse, get
            messy, go back to the basics and make something fucking original.
            Creativity is a fucking work-ethic. Think about all the fucking
            possibilities. Design is all about fucking relationships—the
            relationship of form and content, the relationship of elements, the
            relationship of designer and user. Sometimes it is appropriate to
            place various typographic elements on the outside of the fucking
            left margin of text to maintain a strong vertical axis. This
            practice is referred to as exdenting and is most often used with
            bullets and quotations. Why are you fucking reading all of this? Get
            back to work. This design is fucking brilliant. Learn from fucking
            criticism. You need to sit down and sketch more fucking ideas
            because stalking your ex on facebook isn’t going to get you
            anywhere. Remember it’s called the creative process, it’s not the
            creative fucking moment. The details are not the details. They make
            the fucking design. When you design, you have to draw on your own
            fucking life experiences. If it’s not something you would want to
            read/look at/use then why fucking bother? To go partway is easy, but
            mastering anything requires hard fucking work. While having drinks
            with Tibor Kalman one night, he told me, “When you make something no
            one hates, no one fucking loves it.” Don’t worry about what other
            people fucking think. Respect your fucking craft. Don’t get hung up
            on things that don’t fucking work. When you sit down to work,
            external critics aren’t the enemy. It’s you who you must to fight
            against to do great fucking work. You must overcome yourself.
            Nothing of value comes to you without fucking working at it. Widows
            and orphans are terrible fucking tragedies, both in real life and
            definitely in typography. Practice won’t get you anywhere if you
            mindlessly fucking practice the same thing. Change only occurs when
            you work deliberately with purpose toward a
